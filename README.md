# The Game of Set in Vanilla JavaScript and CSS

This program creates a local web page version of the game of set. It is written using javascript, html, and css. The game can be loaded with the live server extension on visual studio code or by starting a live local web server at the root of the project. 

How to play:
Choose your amount of players and player names. Players will try to find a set of three cards from the 12 cards originally laid out. To be a set the following criteria must be met:       

    -Each card has the same color, or all different
    -Each card has the same number of shapes, or all different
    -Each card has the same filling, or all different
    -Each card has the same shape, or all different

If a set is found, the player that found it gets a point. If a set is not found, three more cards are added to the active deck when you press draw 3 and the players may try again to find a set. The player with the most points wins!
